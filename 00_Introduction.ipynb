    "\n",
    "### Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is a simple, high-level programming language that’s easy to read and write.\n",
    "- Its indentation (spaces at the start of a line) defines code structure instead of braces {}.\n",
    "- It’s open-source, free to use, and has a large community, so it’s great for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python environment is where your code runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main types are:\n",
    "- **Global environment**: the default system-wide Python install.\n",
    "- **Virtual environment**: an isolated space for one project’s packages.\n",
    "- **Conda environment**: like virtual envs but managed through Anaconda, useful for data science.\n",
    "- **Google Colab / Jupyter**: cloud-based or notebook-style environments where you can mix code and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "- Notebooks have cells that can contain text or code.\n",
    "- You can edit and run code cells by double-clicking them.\n",
    "- Great for experiments, data analysis, and teaching.\n",
